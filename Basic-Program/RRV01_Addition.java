/*
	if we run above program any number of times it will
	execute only with specifir=ed values 10 and 20 if we want to change
	the new values we have to vhange the source code then compile and again
	then should execute with modified values.

	as a programmer we can modified source code but a customer cannot do change in source code coz he
	dont know java, even if he knows java itis not good
	to modifying source code everytime for new value.

	so we inroduce rrv
